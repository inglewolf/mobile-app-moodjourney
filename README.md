# mobile-app-moodjourney
**MoodJourney** is a mobile application designed to help the user track their emotional  well-being. Much like managing a blog or keeping a diary, users can log their moods and pen down their thoughts but in a much more accessible, efficient &amp; private way.

**Daily Mood Tracker**: Users can select from 3 options to define their general mood of the 
day.  
 
**Reflective Journaling**: Together with picking a mood, users can log a journal entry 
where they may pen down their thoughts & feelings. They can navigate to any date to 
view what they had previously recorded. 
 
**List View**: Users will be able to scroll through a list view of a month’s days. On the days 
they have saved a journal entry, a mood icon to show their selected mood and the 
entry’s title will be displayed. The days that don’t have saved entries, will display with a 
question mark icon and an empty title. 
 
**Privacy**: Users will be required to create an account to access MoodJourney’s features. 
All of a user’s mood & journal logs will be stored safely in their accounts and is not 
accessible to public.
