# MoodJourney
**MoodJourney** is a mobile application designed to help the user track their emotional  well-being. Much like managing a blog or keeping a diary, users can log their moods and pen down their thoughts but in a much more accessible, efficient &amp; private way.

**Daily Mood Tracker**: Users can select from 3 options to define their general mood of the 
day.  
 
**Reflective Journaling**: Together with picking a mood, users can log a journal entry 
where they may pen down their thoughts & feelings. They can navigate to any date to 
view what they had previously recorded. 
 
**List View**: Users will be able to scroll through a list view of a month’s days. On the days 
they have saved a journal entry, a mood icon to show their selected mood and the 
entry’s title will be displayed. The days that don’t have saved entries, will display with a 
question mark icon and an empty title. 
 
**Privacy**: Users will be required to create an account to access MoodJourney’s features. 
All of a user’s mood & journal logs will be stored safely in their accounts and is not 
accessible to public.

## Functionalities of Each Activity

| Activity & Function | Image |
|:---------|:--------:|
|<h3>Main Activity</h3>**UI Elements**:<br><br>• Login ImageButton: Navigates the user to LoginActivity.<br><br>• Sign-Up ImageButton: Navigates the user to RegisterActivity.<br><br>**Functionality**:<br><br>• When the app launches, it starts with MainActivity, presenting the user with two image buttons that takes them to the relevant activity.| <img src="documentation/MainActivity.png" alt="MainActivity" width="200"/>   |
|<h3>LoginActivity</h3>**UI Elements**:<br><br>•	Username Field: An EditText for the user to input their username.<br><br>•	Password Field: An EditText with a password toggle, allowing users to hide or reveal their password.<br><br>•	Login ImageButton: Initiates the login process.<br><br>•	TextView Sign Up Link: Allows user to access RegisterActivity<br><br>**Functionality**:<br><br>•	When the login button is clicked, the application checks if the username and password fields are empty. If either field is empty, a toast message prompts the user to fill in both fields.<br><br>•	If both fields are filled, the entered credentials are sent to loginVolley.php.<br><br>•	A query is used to check if the username exists in the database. If it does, the stored password is retrieved and compared to the one entered by the user. If no such user is found, a toast informs the user of such.<br><br>•	If the passwords match, the user is successfully logged in and redirected to ListViewActivity. If not, a toast informs them that their username or password is invalid.| <img src="documentation/LoginActivity.png" alt="LoginActivity" width="200"/><img src="documentation/LoginActivityInput.png" alt="LoginActivity w/ input" width="200"/>   |
|<h3>RegisterActivity</h3>**UI Elements**:<br><br>• Username: An EditText to input their username.<br><br>• Email: An EditText for the user to input their email address.<br><br>• Password and Confirm Password: EditText fields with toggle buttons to show or hide the entered passwords.<br><br>• Date Picker ImageButton: A button that launches a date picker for selecting the user's birthdate.<br><br>• Birthdate TextView: The date selected from the picker is displayed here.<br><br>• TextView Login Link: Allows user to access LoginActivity<br><br>**Functionality**:<br><br>• The date picker allows users to select their birthdate from a calendar UI. The selected date is then displayed in the birthdate TextView.<br><br>• When the sign-up button is clicked, the application first checks if all fields have been filled. Otherwise, it creates a toast to prompt the user to complete all fields.<br><br>• The application then retrieves all user input and passes it to registerVolley.php for processing.<br><br>• The back end checks if a user with the entered username or email already exists in the database. If such a user exists, the back end echoes a status message to the application, triggering a toast that displays “User already exists.”<br><br>• If there is no such user, the back end runs an SQL query to insert the new user’s details into the database. After successful insertion, the user is prompted with a toast to log in with their new account and re-directed to LoginActivity.|<img src="documentation/RegisterActivity.png" alt="RegisterActivity" width="200"/><img src="documentation/RegisterDatePicker.png" alt="Date Picker" width="200"/>   |
| <h3>ListViewActivity</h3>**UI Elements**:<br><br>• ListView: Displays each day of the month as a list item.

The month and year are displayed between these buttons.<br><br>• Calendar ImageButton: Initially intended to switch to a calendar view, but currently non-functional.<br><br>• Person ImageButton: Passes the user id and takes the user to ProfileActivity.<br><br>**Functionality**:<br><br>• Upon loading, the application sends the current user’s id and the selected month to getEntriesListVolley.php.<br><br>• The back-end program uses the provided details to fetch the entries of the selected month that were written by the selected user from the database. The data of those entries is sent to the application for further processing.<br><br>• Back in the application, the number of days of the selected month is retrieved from the stored array. It then loops through each day of the month. If there is an entry saved on that day, the entry’s details are displayed in the list item. Otherwise, the list item displays the default.<br><br>• The user can click into any of the list items. If the list item has an existing entry, the entry’s id will be passed on as an extra and the user will be taken to JournalEntryActivity. If there is no saved entry, the user will be taken to Add_Activity.|<img src="documentation/ListView.png" alt="ListViewActivity" width="200"/><img src="documentation/ListView2.png" alt="ListViewActivity variation" width="200"/>   |

If they click yes, a request is sent to deleteEntryVolley.php.<br><br>• There, the server sends a query to get the user id of the selected entry. Then, a query is sent to delete the selected entry. The user’s id and the status message are sent back to the application.<br><br>• Upon successful deletion, the current activity ends, and the user is taken back to ListViewActivity.<br><br>• When the save button is clicked, all user input from the EditTexts and the value of the selected radio button is sent to saveExistingEntryVolley.php.<br><br>• There, a query is sent to update the relevant details of the current entry in the database.<br><br>• After updating successfully, the user is taken back to JournalEntryActivity to view the saved changes to their entry.<br><br> |<img src="documentation/EditActivity.png" alt="EditActivity" width="200"/><img src="documentation/EditDelete.png" alt="Delete Entry" width="200"/>   |

## Personal Reflection

This subject and the project have been challenging for me. However, the project has really helped me to sum up and apply all the things we had learnt throughout the semester and in doing so, helped me to understand the subject better. I also appreciate that I got the chance to explore deeper into the capabilities of Android Studio and creating a mobile application. 

For example, for my user registration and edit profile pages, I decided to implement a date picker so that users could easily select a date. This required a little bit of research and experimenting. Apart from getting the date picker to work as required, I also managed to customize its aesthetic. 

While applying layout constraints was often challenging and kept me on the edge of my seat, the satisfaction of achieving the intend design aesthetic & user interface, was a great consolation. However, I hope to be able to better understand how constraints work and more importantly, how to design an application with different screen dimensions in mind. 

Due to time constraints, I was not able to complete the Calender view and implement a image selector for the user’s profile image. However, if time permits in the future, I would like to be able to explore further and figure those out as well.
